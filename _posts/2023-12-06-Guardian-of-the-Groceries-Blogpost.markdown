Hi! My name is Max Mustermann and I recently finished a 10-month Java programming course at [everyone codes](https://everyonecodes.io/). In order to practice our newly-gained skills in Java and Spring Boot, we had 6 weeks to work on a small project of our choice. As an avid language learner, I decided to write a small clone of Anki, a program that allows you to create and review flashcards. 

In this blog post, I want to talk about the difference between the `@OneToMany` and `@ManyToOne` annotation. It took me a lot of research to properly understand the difference and when to use which one, so I hope that I can save you some hours of tedious research by summarizing my findings in this blog post!
